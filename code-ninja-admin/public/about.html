            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Code Ninja! was founded in 2024 by a group of enthusiastic coders in the AI&DS Department. What started as a small coding group quickly grew into a full-fledged club, hosting regular competitions, workshops, and hackathons. Our journey has just begun, and weâ€™re excited to see what the future holds!</p>
